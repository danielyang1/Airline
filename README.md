# Airline

The airline creation project was definitely the most stressful project thus far. It required many new concepts and ideas in which I wasn't completely comfortable with yet. The research process was somewhat challenging but nowhere near as stressful as the collaboration and project layout. 

I used JSON to write to a file. From my research via YouTube, I learned there were many ways to do this but I chose the one that I understood the best.

I'm still not quite comfortable with WPF yet. I need to ask a lot of questions about data-binding and MVVM, although I do understand it a lot more than I did before. 

I need to keep things simple and run with my ideas. Thinking too much prevents progress for me.

I'm most proud of my logic and being able to connect them to the WPF. I need work on organizing my logic so it complies with MVVM.
